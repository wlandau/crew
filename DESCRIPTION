Title: A Distributed Worker Launcher Framework
Description: In computationally demanding analysis projects,
  statisticians and data scientists asynchronously
  deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems,
  ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services.
  The 'NNG'-powered 'mirai' R package by Gao (2023)
  <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mirai> is a sleek
  and sophisticated scheduler that
  efficiently processes these intense workloads.
  The 'crew' package extends 'mirai' with a unifying
  interface for third-party worker launchers.
  Inspiration also comes from packages.
