# crew 0.9.0.9001 (development)

* Require `mirai` >= 0.12.1.2.

# crew 0.9.0

* Require `nanonext` >= 0.12.0 and `mirai` >= 0.12.0.
* Return to always re-launching backlogged inactive workers (#79, https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai/discussions/95).
* Implement `push_backlog()` and `pop_backlog()` to manage cases when it is not desirable to push to saturated controllers (https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/1220).
* Invisibly return the `mirai` object of a task pushed to the controller. This allows users to interact with the task directly, e.g. to create a promise object with `promises::as.promise()` (#146, @jcheng5).
* Add a new `walk()` method for controllers and controller groups to submit tasks in batch and return control immediately without waiting for any task to complete (#148, @jcheng5).
* Revive the `collect()` method for popping multiple tasks at once (#148, @jcheng5).
* Add controller group methods `nonempty()`, `resolved()`, `unresolved()`, and `unpopped()` to help with #148.
* Make the `mirai` dispatcher error message extremely verbose.

# crew 0.8.0

* Configure workers to send themselves a termination signal if the connection to the dispatcher is broken (#141, @psychelzh). Huge thanks to @shikokuchuo for the support through https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai/issues/87, https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai/pull/88, and https://github.com/shikokuchuo/nanonext/pull/25! The signal itself is platform-dependent and determined by the new function `crew_terminate_signal()`.
* Implement `crew_monitor_local()` to help users monitor and terminate local R processes created by `crew` and `mirai`.
* Implement new utility function `crew_terminate_process()` to terminate a process manually without resorting to `SIGKILL` on Windows.
* Throw a warning from `controller$map()` if at least one task threw one. `warnings = FALSE` suppresses this behavior.
* Set `output = TRUE` in `daemon()` so `stdout` and `stderr` streams print.
* Add new arguments `local_log_directory` and `local_log_join` to write to local log files.

# crew 0.7.0

* Migrate from `asyncdial` to `autoexit`.
* Use `Sys.info()[["user"]]` to get the user in `crew_clean()` (#135, @luwidmer).
* Use condition variables to wait for tasks more efficiently (#108).
* Because of #108, `controller$map()` can no longer be used if there are tasks waiting to be popped.
* Use a `cli` progress bar in `map()`.
* Encapsulate non-function `R6` members in the `private` list and add active bindings where interfaces are necessary (#137). Ad hoc tests that absolutely need to modify private objects can use `object$.__enclos_env__$private` trick, but these tests should be skipped on CRAN in case there is a change to `R6` that breaks this.
* Drop `.signal` from `mirai::mirai()` since all `mirai` tasks signal as of `mirai` version 0.11.2.9025.
* Implement `crew_throttle()`, a decoupled mechanism for throttling that can be applied to scaling.
* Bring back the `throttle` argument, powered by `crew_throttle()`.
* Retry `mirai::status()` again in `daemons_info()` and make it configurable using `seconds_interval` and `seconds_timeout` in both the client and the launcher (#128).

# crew 0.6.0

* Migrate checks to enforce features in version 0.5.0 for reverse dependencies.
* Drop check of backlogged workers, c.f. https://github.com/shikokuchuo/mirai/discussions/63#discussioncomment-7051889 (#79, #124, @shikokuchuo).
* Deprecate `seconds_exit` because `exitlinger` in `mirai` is now obsolete (#125, @shikokuchuo).
* Use `mirai::nextget("cv")` to count unresolved tasks instead of looping through all the task objects (#131).
* Remove throttling and `collect()` in auto-scaling. Simplifies much of the code. Made possible by the efficiency gains in #131.
* Simplify `wait()`.
* `seconds_interval` in `map()` no longer defaults to `controller$client$seconds_interval`.
* `launcher$terminate_workers()` terminates one or more workers, and `launcher$terminate` terminates the whole launcher.
* Add infrastructure to let custom launcher plugins launch and terminate workers asynchronously (#133). Launchers can set a positive number in the `processes` field to set the number of local `mirai` daemons for asynchronous requests to launch and terminate the serious workers. Then, `launch_worker()` and `terminate_worker()` can optionally make use of `launcher$async$eval()` to send these asynchronous calls.

# crew 0.5.0

* Suppress interactive browser on Windows which launched on each worker previously (@psychelzh).
* Migrate to the new host/daemon nomenclature in `mirai` 0.9.1 (#96).
* Suppress `status()` retries (@shikokuchuo, #100).
* Implement `launch_max` to error out if workers repeatedly launch without completing any tasks (#101, @shikokuchuo, @multimeric).
* Detect discovered workers more robustly in `launcher$done()`.
* Add a new `algorithm` argument to the `push()`, `shove()`, and `map()` methods of controllers and controller groups, as well as arguments/fields in `crew_eval()` and its return value (#113, @shikokuchuo).
* As a default for pseudo-random number generation, leverage widely-spaced L'Ecuyer streams as supported by `mirai::nextstream()` (#115, @shikokuchuo).
* Move README documentation to vignettes.
* Add a new `crew_tls()` function for TLS configuration (#120).
* Deprecate the `tls_enable` and `tls_config` arguments of `crew_client()` etc. in favor of a `tls` argument which accepts `crew_tls()` objects (#120).

# crew 0.4.0

## Highlights

* Use the TLS capabilities of `nanonext` and `mirai`.
* Add a `map()` method to the controller class for functional programming (#93).
* Fix bug in `scale()` which launched too many workers when `active - demand` was less than 0.
* Add `crew_clean()` to help clean up any lingering dispatchers and workers from previous sessions.

## Other improvements

* Remove temporary controller summary workaround that ensured CRAN compatibility with `targets` 1.1.3.
* Add guardrails to make sure the controller is started for methods that require this. Part of this involved improving the error messages.
* Retry `daemons()` in `daemons_info()`.

# crew 0.3.0

* Track warnings properly (#81, @brendanf).
* Optimize heavily (#81, #83, @shikokuchuo, @brendanf).
* Use CRAN `nanonext` 0.9.0.
* Delegate the task pushing and collection logic to a new `R6` schedule class (#84).
* Delegate auto-scaling to the launcher (#84).
* Drastically simplify internal logic (#84).
* Rename "router" to "client" and change the function signature of `launch_worker()` (#84). Unfortunately neither of these changes is back-compatible for third-party launcher plugins. However, the controller interface is still back-compatible, so `targets` remains unaffected.
* Terminate "lost" workers on websocket rotation.
* Allow `NULL` result in `pop()$result[[1L]]`.
* Delegate summaries among the controller, schedule, launcher, and client.

* Reorganize `pkgdown` reference and `Rd` families to clarify which parts are for end-users and which parts are for launcher plugin developers.
* Add `controller$shove()` and `schedule$list()` to support fast extensions for functional programming.
* Depend on `mirai` 0.9.0 or greater.

* Remove `clean()` and instead terminate lost workers on launch.
* Fix examples.
* Add a `collect` argument to `pop()`.

* Open and confirm bus socket listeners asynchronously in the launcher abstract class (#58).
* Use condition variables to test the connection status of worker instances (#57, @shikokuchuo).
* Allow the dispatcher process to not exist so that the router will keep working if `mirai` implements the dispatcher another way (#60).
* Add a `substitute` argument to `push()` (#63).
* Remove dependency on custom NNG bus sockets, which significantly simplifies the internals, improves robustness, and smooths the integration with `mirai` (#61).
* Use `processx` instead of `callr` for the local process launcher (#64").
* Speed up `crew_eval()` by e.g. relying on `nanonext::mclock()` for the time.
