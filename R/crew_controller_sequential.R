    #' @param substitute Logical of length 1, whether to call
    #'   `base::substitute()` on the supplied value of the

    #'   literally as you write it, e.g.
    #'   `push(command = your_function_call())`. If `FALSE`, then `crew`
    #'   assumes `command` is a language object and you are passing its
    #'   value, e.g. `push(command = quote(your_function_call()))`.
    #'   `substitute = TRUE` is appropriate for interactive use,
    #'   whereas `substitute = FALSE` is meant for automated R programs
    #'   that invoke `crew` controllers.
    #' @param seed Integer of length 1 with the pseudo-random number generator
    #'   seed to set for the evaluation of the task. Passed to the
    #'   `seed` argument of `set.seed()` if not `NULL`.
    #'   If `algorithm` and `seed` are both `NULL` for the sequential
    #'   controller, then the random number generator defaults to the
    #'   current RNG of the local R session where the sequential
    #'   controller lives.
    #' @param algorithm Integer of length 1 with the pseudo-random number
    #'   generator algorithm to set for the evaluation of the task.
    #'   Passed to the `kind` argument of `RNGkind()` if not `NULL`.
    #'   If `algorithm` and `seed` are both `NULL` for the sequential
    #'   controller, then the random number generator defaults to the
    #'   current RNG of the local R session where the sequential
    #'   controller lives.
    #' @param packages Character vector of packages to load for the task.
    #' @param library Library path to load the packages. See the `lib.loc`
    #'   argument of `require()`.
    #' @param seconds_timeout Not used in the sequential controller..
    #' @param scale Not used in the sequential controller.
    #' @param throttle Not used in the sequential controller.
    #' @param name Character string, name of the task. If `NULL`, then
    #'   a random name is generated automatically.
    #'   The name of the task must not conflict with the name of another
    #'   task pushed to the controller. Any previous task with the same name
    #'   must first be popped before a new task with that name can be pushed.
    #' @param save_command Deprecated on 2025-01-22 (`crew` version
    #'   0.10.2.9004) and no longer used.
    #' @param controller Not used. Included to ensure the signature is
