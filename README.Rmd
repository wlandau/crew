In computationally demanding analysis projects, statisticians and data scientists asynchronously deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems, ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services. The [NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org)-powered [`mirai`](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai) R package is a sleek and sophisticated scheduler that efficiently processes these intense workloads. The `crew` package extends [`mirai`](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai) with a unifying interface for third-party worker launchers. Inspiration also comes from packages [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/), [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/), [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/), and [`batchtools`](https://github.com/mlr-org/batchtools).

# Risks

The `crew` package has unavoidable risks, and the user is responsible for safety, security, and computational resources. Please read the [software license](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/LICENSE.html) and the [vignette about specific known risks](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/articles/risks.html).

# Thanks

The `crew` package incorporates insightful ideas from the following people.

* [Charlie Gao](https://github.com/shikokuchuo) created [`mirai`](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai) and [`nanonext`](https://github.com/r-lib/nanonext) and graciously accommodated the complicated and demanding feature requests that made `crew` possible.
* [Rich FitzJohn](https://github.com/richfitz) and [Robert Ashton](https://github.com/r-ash) developed [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq//).
* [Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/) developed [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) and wrote an [edifying blog post on implementing task queues](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/callr-task-q/).
* [Kirill Müller](https://github.com/krlmlr/) created the [`workers`](https://github.com/wlandau/workers) prototype, an initial effort that led directly to the current implementation of `crew`. `crew` would not exist without Kirill's insights about orchestration models for R processes.
* [Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/futureverse/). Henrik's [`future`](https://github.com/futureverse/future/) package ecosystem demonstrates the incredible power of a consistent R interface on top of a varying collection of high-performance computing technologies.
* [Michael Schubert](https://github.com/mschubert/). Michael's [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/) package supports efficient high-performance computing on traditional clusters, and it demonstrates the value of a central `R6` object to manage an entire collection of persistent workers.
* [David Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch). The [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) R package is a powerful interface to Amazon Web Services, and the documentation clearly communicates the capabilities and limitations of AWS to R users.
* [Adam Banker](https://github.com/adambanker), co-authored [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) with [David Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch).
* [David Neuzerling](https://github.com/mdneuzerling). David's [`lambdr`](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/lambdr/) package establishes a helpful pattern to submit and collect AWS Lambda jobs from R.
* [Mark Edmondson](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/). Mark maintains several R packages to interface with Google Cloud Platform such as [`googleCloudStorageR`](https://github.com/cloudyr/googleCloudStorageR) and [`googleCloudRunner`](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner), and he [started the conversation](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/720) around helping [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) submit jobs to Google Cloud Run.
* [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5) for sparking the integration of `crew` with [`promises`](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/).
