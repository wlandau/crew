The [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/) package leverages
[Redis](https://redis.io), a state-of-the-art transactional in-memory
database, to provide a powerful task queue for R. With interprocess
communication, automatic down-scaling, and error handling,
[`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/) orchestrates tasks at scale. The
`crew` package extends [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/) with
components to deploy workers to a variety of distributed computing
environments. With its unifying interface to multiple high-performance
computing platforms, `crew` resembles packages
[`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/),
[`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/), and
[`batchtools`](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/).

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("wlandau/crew")
```

## Documentation

## Thanks

The `crew` package incorporates insightful ideas from the following
people.

- [Rich FitzJohn](https://github.com/richfitz) and [Robert
  Ashton](https://github.com/r-ash) developed
  [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq//). `crew` is merely an
  extension of their work.
- [Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/) developed
  [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) and wrote an [edifying blog
  post on implementing task
  queues](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/callr-task-q/).
- [Kirill Müller](https://github.com/krlmlr/) created the
  [`workers`](https://github.com/wlandau/workers) prototype, an initial
  effort that led directly to the current implementation of `crew`.
  `crew` would not exist without Kirill’s insights about orchestration
  models for R processes.
- [Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/). Henrik’s
  [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/) package
  ecosystem demonstrates the incredible power of a consistent R
  interface on top of a varying collection of high-performance computing
  technologies.
- [Michael Schubert](https://github.com/mschubert/). Michael’s
  [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/) package supports
  efficient high-performance computing on traditional clusters, and it
  demonstrates the value of a central `R6` object to manage an entire
  collection of persistent workers.
- [David Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch). The
  [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) R package is a powerful
  interface to Amazon Web Services, and the documentation clearly
  communicates the capabilities and limitations of AWS to R users.
- [Adam Banker](https://github.com/adambanker), co-authored
  [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) with [David
  Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch).
- [David Neuzerling](https://github.com/mdneuzerling). David’s
  [`lambdr`](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/lambdr/) package
  establishes a helpful pattern to submit and collect AWS Lambda jobs
  from R.
- [Mark Edmondson](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/). Mark
  maintains several R packages to interface with Google Cloud Platform
  such as
  [`googleCloudStorageR`](https://github.com/cloudyr/googleCloudStorageR)
  and
  [`googleCloudRunner`](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner),
  and he [started the
  conversation](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/720) around
  helping [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) submit jobs
  to Google Cloud Run.
