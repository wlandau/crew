# crew: a distributed worker launcher framework

In computationally demanding analysis projects, statisticians and data
scientists asynchronously deploy long-running tasks to distributed
systems, ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services. The
[NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org)-powered
[`mirai`](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai) R package is a sleek and
sophisticated scheduler that efficiently processes these intense
workloads. The `crew` package extends
[`mirai`](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai) with a unifying interface for
third-party worker launchers. Inspiration also comes from packages
[`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/),
[`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/),
[`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/), and
[`batchtools`](https://github.com/mlr-org/batchtools).

# Risks

The `crew` package has unavoidable risks, and the user is responsible
for safety, security, and computational resources. Please read the
[software license](https://wlandau.github.io/crew/LICENSE.html) and the

# Thanks

The `crew` package incorporates insightful ideas from the following
people.

- [Charlie Gao](https://github.com/shikokuchuo) created
  [`mirai`](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai) and
  [`nanonext`](https://github.com/r-lib/nanonext) and graciously
  accommodated the complicated and demanding feature requests that made
  `crew` possible.
- [Rich FitzJohn](https://github.com/richfitz) and [Robert
  Ashton](https://github.com/r-ash) developed
  [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq//).
- [Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/) developed
  [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) and wrote an [edifying blog
  post on implementing task
  queues](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/callr-task-q/).
- [Kirill Müller](https://github.com/krlmlr/) created the
  [`workers`](https://github.com/wlandau/workers) prototype, an initial
  effort that led directly to the current implementation of `crew`.
  `crew` would not exist without Kirill’s insights about orchestration
  models for R processes.
- [Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/futureverse/). Henrik’s
  [`future`](https://github.com/futureverse/future/) package ecosystem
  demonstrates the incredible power of a consistent R interface on top
  of a varying collection of high-performance computing technologies.
- [Michael Schubert](https://github.com/mschubert/). Michael’s
  [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/) package supports
  efficient high-performance computing on traditional clusters, and it
  demonstrates the value of a central `R6` object to manage an entire
  collection of persistent workers.
- [David Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch). The
  [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) R package is a powerful
  interface to Amazon Web Services, and the documentation clearly
  communicates the capabilities and limitations of AWS to R users.
- [Adam Banker](https://github.com/adambanker), co-authored
  [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) with [David
  Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch).
- [David Neuzerling](https://github.com/mdneuzerling). David’s
  [`lambdr`](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/lambdr/) package
  establishes a helpful pattern to submit and collect AWS Lambda jobs
  from R.
- [Mark Edmondson](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/). Mark
  maintains several R packages to interface with Google Cloud Platform
  such as
  [`googleCloudStorageR`](https://github.com/cloudyr/googleCloudStorageR)
  and
  [`googleCloudRunner`](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner),
  and he [started the
  conversation](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/720) around
  helping [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) submit jobs
  to Google Cloud Run.
- [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5) for sparking the integration
  of `crew` with [`promises`](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/).
